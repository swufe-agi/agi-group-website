abstract: Group-oriented applications generally support communications for multiple entities (e.g., users and/or devices) through open networks. Typical requirements of group communications include secrecy, authentication, sender non-repudiation, and sender privacy. However, conventional approaches such as group key agreement and broadcast encryption are generally not designed to achieve all these requirements simultaneously or efficiently. In this article, we propose a one-round dynamic authenticated asymmetric group key agreement with sender non-repudiation and privacy (DAAGKAwSNP) protocol. A key building block of our DAAGKAwSNP protocol is our proposed batch multi-signature scheme with strong unforgeability. We prove that the DAAGKAwSNP protocol achieves secrecy under chosen ciphertext attacks – CCA, assuming the intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman and k-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent problem. We also evaluate DAAGKAwSNP’s performance to demonstrate its utility.

While the effectiveness of deep graph learning is recognized across various disciplines, the nuances of vague graph learning — whether its inherent vagueness should be incorporated or disregarded and its influence on deep graph learning efficiency — remain largely unexamined. We fill this gap by introducing a novel decoupled graph learning framework. This is achieved by proposing a matrix-based or a tensor-based fusion module to estimate unobservable node attributes, a hybrid attention mechanism to bridge nodes with both explicit and implicit relationships, and a message-passing mechanism for feature-sensitive transporting. The design principle of decoupling allows it to accommodate ambiguities in any or all of these aspects of node representation, linking, and message passing. Furthermore, we leverage an extensive stock dataset spanning 64 years across the entire U.S. market to assess our framework. This real-world data not only adds a practical dimension to our study but also highlights the effectiveness of vague graph learning. Remarkably, our framework demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms, marking performance enhancements of at least 6.73%, 7.25%, and 11.39% in terms of Rank IC, R2, and Rank ICIR, respectively.r slide deck's filename without extension.
